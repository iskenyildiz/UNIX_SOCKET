# UNIX SOCKET PROGRAM FOR SENDING MESSAGE

This is a UNIX Socket application which lets the server socket and client socket under the same host message each other.

Open the two shells simultaneously and run the files.

First we let client message the server and after we hit 'DONE', it's server's turn to send messages now and vice-versa.

Hit 'end' to end sequence.
